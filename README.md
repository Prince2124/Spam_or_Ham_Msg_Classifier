# Spam or Ham Message Classification
The purpose of this project is to understand how we can use machine learning algorithm to build SMS spam detection model. Particularly, we will build a binary classification model to detect whether a text message is spam or not. A lot of times they ask us to fill in forms and ask our personal information or Account number details which is really fishy or bound to be a fraud. The goal of this project is to use Data Science to accurately classify whether a message is spam or not.
