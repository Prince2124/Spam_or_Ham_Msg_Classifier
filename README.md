# Spam or Ham Message Classification
How often have we come across messages saying we have won a trip to Hawai or won a million dollar or won a cash prize. This form of scam through text messages which are genrally spam messages is called smishing. A lot of times they ask us to fill in forms and ask our personal information or SSN number which is really fishy or bound to be a fraud. The goal of this project is to use Data Science to accurately classify whether a message is spam or not.
